# UX-Nuggets
 
## What is this?
In an organization where multiple research studies are conducted every week, month, or year by a variety of researchers, these reports pile up quickly. Then, when a team member, executive, or client asks a question about a certain topic (e.g., what do we know about how our users book conference rooms?), thereâ€™s a need to rely on the long-term memory of researchers who happened to conduct related studies. 

Inspired by this insight, I created a database for the future designers of the imaginary Martian Frontiers Colony to consolidate user research data and synthesise insights to guide them through their design processes. Each observation and related insights are logged as a "nugget" that any member of the organisation can query and refer to.

## Key Info
This project was completed in the course of 6 weeks from zero knowledge of Javascript, SQL, Front-end and Back-end programming during the Summer Term of the 2019-20 academic year for my Computing-2:Applications module. We were required to write a web application from scratch without the use of frameworks, utilising best practices. This was a solo project. 

Recently I have improved upon the code I wrote last year, improving the modularity of the program, the UI, and testing. 

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Navigate to the program's working directory 'UX-Nuggets' in the terminal.
3. Install dependencies with 
    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```
4. To view the web-app on your browser, type 
    ```bash
    $ node server.js
    ``` 
to run the program on port 8080 of your computer.

## How does it work?

## Tests
