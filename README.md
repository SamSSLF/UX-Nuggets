# UX-Nuggets
 
## What is this?
In an organization where multiple research studies are conducted every week, month, or year by a variety of researchers, these reports pile up quickly. Then, when a team member, executive, or client asks a question about a certain topic (e.g., what do we know about how our users book conference rooms?), thereâ€™s a need to rely on the long-term memory of researchers who happened to conduct related studies. 

Inspired by this insight, I created a database for the future designers of the imaginary Martian Frontiers Colony to consolidate user research data and synthesise insights to guide them through their design processes. Each observation and related insights are logged as a "nugget" that any member of the organisation can query and refer to.
